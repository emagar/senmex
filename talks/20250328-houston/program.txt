Fransico Cantú was a dedicated scholar and professor whose work left a lasting impact on the field of political science. Born in Puebla, Mexico, he earned his Ph.D. at the University of California, San Diego, where he began his research on electoral integrity. His commitment to solving real-world problems.
In 2013, Dr. Cantú joined the University of Houston as an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science, where he earned widespread recognition for his contributions to both academia and the broader community. Among his many achievements, he co-directed the Hobby School's Survey Research Institute and served as an instructor for the Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM) Summer Institute, helping to shape the next generation of scholars.
Dr. Cantú's dedication to research, mentorship, and community remains a lasting legacy that continues to inspire those who had the privilege to work with him. As we gather to remember him—his family, colleagues, and friends—we honor his exceptional contributions to both the academic world and the communities he served.
