Title: A collection of roll call votes in the Mexican Senate, 2005--2011

Author: Eric Magar

Summary: This paper distributes new data for the Mexican Senate. Francisco Cantú's early work in Mexican politics researched roll call votes. He published work on the influence of governors over federal lawmakers and on inference validity with incomplete data. His work, and the field of congressional politics since, leaves the Senate plenary in the shadows due to the upper chamber not publishing roll calls like the lower chamber routinely does.

Attempting a remedy, Cantú began retrieving the missing data directly from the Senate's /Diario de sesiones/. He shared with me a sample of registries scraped from the Senate's web page. While we agreed on the worth of that missing link, we also anticipated that systematizing the information was time intensive. We never undertook this, the project remained on the back burner.

This paper completes the data systematization, providing a general description of the sample of votes included. It also charts the steps to obtain full data for the period and extend coverage to the present day, in the hope that the late Francisco's students will undertake the full project.

In email exchanges, Francisco pointed that roll call votes would need to be retrieved directly in the Senate's /Diario de sesiones/, and sent a sample of registries in html format---a project that we never undertook as it was labor intensive.

This paper systematizes the raw data that Francisco collected, making it available in a public repository. 

 

He explored the lower chamber only. The Senate remained in full obscurity, due to the upper chamber not publishing roll call vote data like the lower chamber routinely does.

One reason for the lopsided approach is the lack of systematized data for the upper chamber. Exchanging emails in 2014, Francisco pointed that senators roll call votes would need to be scraped directly from the web page. He sent me a sample that  

He was enquiring about Senate roll call votes, and I remember mentioning that the upper chamber didn't publicize its votes like the chamber did. He said some time later that he had found a bunch of roll call votes in the Senate diario, and sent me the web transcripts. 



Hi Jeff, I need to ask you about the status of roll call vote data for the Mexican Senate. 

I'm participating in a conference panel honoring Cantú in Houston next week. I could again summarize his 1988 APSR article. But I might also systematize and make public data that Francisco sent me years ago, when he was still a student at UCSD.

I do not recall the exact context. He was enquiring about Senate roll call votes, and I remember mentioning that the upper chamber didn't publicize its votes like the chamber did. He said some time later that he had found a bunch of roll call votes in the Senate diario, and sent me the web transcripts. 

I believe that Francisco never systematized the data, because in his UCSD papers he worked with the chamber only. 

Considering the Legistature-year, the diario frequencies he sent me look thus:

59-2 N=98   (Feb-Apr 2005)
59-3 N=265  (Sep-Dec 2005 and Feb-Apr 2006)
60-1 N=136  (Sep-Dec 2006 and Feb-Apr 2007)
60-2 N=2    (Sep-Oct 2007)
61-2 N=136  (Sep-Dec 2010 and Feb-Apr 2011)

Most diario entires include a single roll call vote, but several have more. There appear to be 700+ votes in total from my exploration.

Does it make sense to clean all this and make the data public? Finalizing involves a good deal of work.
