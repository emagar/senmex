Hi Jeff, I need to ask you about the status of roll call vote data for the Mexican Senate. 

I'm participating in a conference panel honoring Cant√∫ in Houston next week. I could again summarize his 1988 APSR article. But I might also systematize and make public data that Francisco sent me years ago, when he was still a student at UCSD.

I do not recall the exact context. He was enquiring about Senate roll call votes, and I remember mentioning that the upper chamber didn't publicize its votes like the chamber did. He said some time later that he had found a bunch of roll call votes in the Senate diario, and sent me the web transcripts. 

I believe that Francisco never systematized the data, because in his UCSD papers he worked with the chamber only. 

Considering the Legistature-year, the diario frequencies he sent me look thus:

59-2 N=98   (Feb-Apr 2005)
59-3 N=265  (Sep-Dec 2005 and Feb-Apr 2006)
60-1 N=136  (Sep-Dec 2006 and Feb-Apr 2007)
60-2 N=2    (Sep-Oct 2007)
61-2 N=136  (Sep-Dec 2010 and Feb-Apr 2011)

Most diario entires include a single roll call vote, but several have more. There appear to be 700+ votes in total from my exploration.

Does it make sense to clean all this and make the data public? Finalizing involves a good deal of work.
